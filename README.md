# htypist - Python Code Type
### How to Play

1. **Start the game**: Run the script and press Enter at the welcome screen
2. **Type the code**: A Python code snippet will appear - type it line by line
3. **Auto-indentation**: The game automatically provides the correct indentation for each line (like modern IDEs)
4. **Visual feedback**:
   - Green text indicates correct typing
   - Red text indicates errors
5. **Complete the round**: The game automatically moves to the next line, and completes when all lines are typed
6. **View results**: See your typing speed, accuracy, and performance feedback
7. **Continue or quit**: Choose to practice with another snippet or exit

### Controls

- **Enter**: Move to the next line (indentation provided automatically)
- **Ctrl+C**: Quit the game at any time
- **Ctrl+D**: Skip remaining lines
- **y/yes**: Continue to next round when prompted
- **n/no**: Exit after completing a roundmand-line typing game designed to help you practice typing Python code snippets with real-time feedback and performance tracking.

## Features

- **Real-time Feedback**: Green text for correct characters, red for errors
- **Performance Metrics**: Calculate typing speed (WPM) and accuracy percentage
- **Python Code Snippets**: Practice with real Python code patterns
- **Clean Terminal Interface**: Uses ANSI colors for an engaging experience
- **Cross-platform**: Works on macOS, Linux, and Windows
- **No Dependencies**: Uses only Python standard libraries

## Installation

1. Clone or download this repository
2. Ensure you have Python 3.6+ installed
3. No additional packages required!

## Usage

Run the game from your terminal:

```bash
python3 htypist.py
```

### How to Play

1. **Start the game**: Run the script and press Enter at the welcome screen
2. **Type the code**: A Python code snippet will appear - type it line by line
3. **Multi-line input**: The game will prompt you for each line of code
4. **Visual feedback**:
   - Green text indicates correct typing
   - Red text indicates errors
5. **Complete the round**: The game automatically moves to the next line, and completes when all lines are typed
6. **View results**: See your typing speed, accuracy, and performance feedback
7. **Continue or quit**: Choose to practice with another snippet or exit

### Controls

- **Enter**: Move to the next line or complete the current typing round
- **Ctrl+C**: Quit the game at any time
- **Ctrl+D**: Skip remaining lines (on empty line)
- **y/yes**: Continue to next round when prompted
- **n/no**: Exit after completing a round

## Code Snippets

The game includes a comprehensive collection of Python code patterns covering:

### **Core Python**
- Function definitions and decorators
- Class declarations and OOP concepts
- Exception handling and context managers
- List comprehensions and control structures
- File operations and JSON handling

### **Machine Learning & Data Science**
- **PyTorch**: Neural networks, tensors, training loops, data loaders
- **Scikit-learn**: Model training, preprocessing, pipelines, hyperparameter tuning
- **TensorFlow/Keras**: Model building, data augmentation, custom training
- **Pandas/NumPy**: Data manipulation, analysis, and visualization
- **Advanced ML**: MLflow, Optuna optimization, Transformers/BERT

### **Cloud & Production**
- **Google Cloud**: Storage, BigQuery, AI Platform, Secret Manager
- **MLOps**: Model deployment, monitoring, and versioning
- **Data Engineering**: ETL pipelines and data processing

### **Specialized Libraries**
- Data visualization with Matplotlib and Seaborn
- Statistical analysis with SciPy
- Feature engineering and selection
- Deep learning frameworks and pre-trained models

This diverse corpus helps you practice typing patterns commonly used in:
- Data science and machine learning projects
- Cloud-based AI/ML deployments
- Production ML systems
- Research and experimentation workflows

## Performance Levels

- üéâ **Python Typing Master**: 95%+ accuracy, 40+ WPM
- üëç **Great**: 90%+ accuracy, 30+ WPM
- üëå **Good**: 80%+ accuracy
- üí™ **Keep Practicing**: Below 80% accuracy

## Technical Details

- **Typing Speed**: Calculated as Words Per Minute (WPM) using the standard of 5 characters = 1 word
- **Accuracy**: Percentage of correctly typed characters
